Interactive Power BI dashboard developed for a private physiotherapy clinic to help the client better understand business performance, patient behavior, and insurance claim trends.

<span style="color:#4a89c2; font-size:22px;"><b>Motivation</b></span>

Private individual healthcare providers often lack access to robust data visualization tools that can help streamline their operations, improve customer satisfaction, and make informed decisions. My client, a practicing physiotherapist, approached me with the goal of consolidating and visualizing their clinic's performance metrics in an interactive and intuitive manner.

The motivation behind this project was to create a user-friendly dashboard that would allow the physiotherapist to:

* Monitor monthly revenue trends  
* Track patient demographics and appointment patterns  
* Evaluate employee performance  
* Understand insurance claim processing outcomes  

<span style="color:#4a89c2; font-size:22px;"><b>Dataset</b></span>  
The dataset was provided by the client and included anonymized patient records, appointment logs, revenue reports, and insurance claim data. Key features of the dataset:

* Time frame: Jan 2024 – Dec 2025  
* Total records: Over 10,000 patient interactions  
* Key columns: Patient age, gender, diagnosis, revenue, shift, employee name, insurance status, claim status  

<span style="color:#4a89c2; font-size:22px;"><b>Project Overview</b></span>  
The dashboard consists of multiple report pages that provide insights into different aspects of the clinic:

1. Revenue Analysis  
* Monthly revenue trends for the clinic and individual employees  
* Revenue comparison by insurance providers and appointment days  

2. Patient Insights  
* Distribution by age group, gender, and preferred shifts  
* Common diagnoses (e.g., osteoarthritis, low back pain)  
* Referral sources (doctor, insurance, Google, etc.)  

3. Appointment Metrics  
* Total appointments, rescheduled, and cancelled  
* Average patient wait time

4. Employee Performance  
* Total patients and sessions handled by each physiotherapist  
* Average rating per employee

5. Insurance Dashboard

<span style="color:#4a89c2; font-size:22px;"><b>Tools & Technologies Used</b></span>  
* Power BI Desktop for dashboard creation and interactivity  
* DAX for calculated columns and KPIs  
* Excel/CSV as the data source (processed by finding errors in ICD codes)  

<span style="color:#4a89c2; font-size:22px;"><b>Key Outcomes</b></span>  
* Helped the client identify the most profitable insurance partners  
* Optimized employee scheduling based on shift-wise patient data  
* Improved focus on high-volume diagnosis types for better specialization  
* Reduced rescheduling through visibility into wait time and cancellations

This project demonstrated how a simple yet powerful dashboard can transform decision-making for small healthcare businesses. It empowered my client, a solo physiotherapy practitioner, to gain data-driven insights that led to more efficient operations, better patient care, and increased revenue transparency.
