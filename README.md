Interactive Power BI dashboard developed for a private physiotherapy clinic to help the client better understand business performance, patient behavior, and insurance claim trends.

# Motivation

Private individual healthcare providers often lack access to robust data visualization tools that can help streamline their operations, improve customer satisfaction, and make informed decisions. My client, a practicing physiotherapist, approached me with the goal of consolidating and visualizing their clinic's performance metrics in an interactive and intuitive manner.

The motivation behind this project was to create a user-friendly dashboard that would allow the physiotherapist to:

*	Monitor monthly revenue trends
*	Track patient demographics and appointment patterns
*	Evaluate employee performance
*	Understand insurance claim processing outcomes

# Dataset
The dataset was provided by the client and included anonymized patient records, appointment logs, revenue reports, and insurance claim data. Key features of the dataset:

* Time frame: Jan 2024 – Dec 2025
* Total records: Over 10,000 patient interactions
* Key columns: Patient age, gender, diagnosis, revenue, shift, employee name, insurance status, claim status

# Project Overview
The dashboard consists of multiple report pages that provide insights into different aspects of the clinic:

1. Revenue Analysis
* Monthly revenue trends for the clinic and individual employees
* Revenue comparison by insurance providers and appointment days

2. Patient Insights
* Distribution by age group, gender, and preferred shifts
* Common diagnoses (e.g., osteoarthritis, low back pain)
* Referral sources (doctor, insurance, Google, etc.)

3. Appointment Metrics
* Total appointments, rescheduled, and cancelled
* Average patient wait time

# Tools & Technologies Used
* Power BI Desktop for dashboard creation and interactivity
* DAX for calculated columns and KPIs
* Excel/CSV as the data source (processed by finding errors in ICD codes)

# Key Outcomes
* Helped the client identify the most profitable insurance partners
* Optimized employee scheduling based on shift-wise patient data
* Improved focus on high-volume diagnosis types for better specialization
* Reduced rescheduling through visibility into wait time and cancellations

# Summary / Conclusion
This project demonstrated how a simple yet powerful dashboard can transform decision-making for small healthcare businesses. It empowered my client, a solo physiotherapy practitioner, to gain data-driven insights that led to more efficient operations, better patient care, and increased revenue transparency.
